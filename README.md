NUS Database
============================================
An up-to-date database for the NUS Downloader.

## How to use
1. Download [NUSD 1.9 Mod](https://wiidatabase.de/downloads/pc-tools/nus-downloader/)
2. Download the [current database.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WiiDatabase/NUS-Database/master/database.xml)
3. Move it to the same directory of the NUSD Mod, overwriting the old database

## Download the entire NUS

**You need at nearly 5 Gigabyte free space!**  

**This does not download encrypted VC and WiiWare!**

**NOTE: This is INCOMPLETE and DOES NOT create an exact copy! E.g. certs are missing from tmd files and it downloads every shared content again!** 

1. Download the [BATCH script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WiiDatabase/NUS-Database/master/download_nus.bat)
2. Move it to the same directory as the NUS Downloader
3. Run the script
